 hey! guys welcome to tutorial
 in these video we are going to talk about loop..
 
 there are majorly 4 type of loop
   1)While Loop
   2)Do-While Loop
   3)for Loop
   4)for each Loop
   
    
    before get into the video  to learn these
    basis of math function
    
    > greater then
    < Less then  
    >= greater then equal
    <= Less then equal
     these 4 simple math functions are like back 
     bone for loop
     
     basically loop is an conditional statement it will
     execute again and again until given condition 
     is satisfied
     
     
     let's begin with while loop
       you will understand easier
     
     
      here is the basic syntax of while loop
      
      //basically will repeat the statement until 
       * the given
       *  function is satisfied
      syn:while(condition)
      {//if the condition is true it will getin to 
      the block
      
      }
  for Example :
     let we take hello we need to print it 10 times 
     
 what will do is 
        system.out.println("hello");
        system.out.println("hello");
        system.out.println("hello");
        system.out.println("hello");
     
  //here we will repeat the code it also called code 
    Redundancy
    
    the code Redundancy is crime
    
    Instead printing like that we have to use the loop
  for executing the multiple times 
       
       here what we need to do is to create the 
       while loop
       
     like these	
     
       we need to initialize the counter
       int i=6;
       while (i>=0)
       {
         System.out.println("hello");
         i++;//then increment the counter
       }
       
       
   in the while loop we can also do some 
   other filtration also like skip particular element 
   &  print only add no. or even number
